#By default stack.sh only clones the project repos if they do not exist in $DEST. 
#stack.sh will freshen each repo on each run if RECLONE is set to yes. This avoids 
#having to manually remove repos in order to get the current branch from $GIT_BASE.

#By default stack.sh only installs Python packages if no version is currently 
#installed or the current version does not match a specified requirement. 
#If PIP_UPGRADE is set to True then existing required Python packages will be 
#upgraded to the most recent version that matches requirements

#========================IP=========================
#IP_VERSION can be used to configure Neutron to create either an IPv4, IPv6, 
#or dual-stack self-service project data-network by with either IP_VERSION=4, 
#IP_VERSION=6, or IP_VERSION=4+6 respectively.
IP_VERSION=4

#DevStack can enable service operation over either IPv4 or IPv6 by setting 
#SERVICE_IP_VERSION to either SERVICE_IP_VERSION=4 or SERVICE_IP_VERSION=6 respectively.
#hen set to 4 devstack services will open listen sockets on 0.0.0.0 and 
#service endpoints will be registered using HOST_IP as the address.
#When set to 6 devstack services will open listen sockets on :: and service 
#endpoints will be registered using HOST_IPV6 as the address.
SERVICE_IP_VERSION=4

# ``HOST_IP`` and ``HOST_IPV6`` should be set manually for best results if
# the NIC configuration of the host is unusual, i.e. ``eth1`` has the default
# route but ``eth0`` is the public interface.  They are auto-detected in
# ``stack.sh`` but often is indeterminate on later runs due to the IP moving
# from an Ethernet interface to a bridge on the host. Setting it here also
# makes it available for ``openrc`` to include when setting ``OS_AUTH_URL``.
# Neither is set by default.

#======================Logging=======================
#By default stack.sh output is only written to the console where it runs. 
#It can be sent to a file in addition to the console by setting LOGFILE 
#to the fully-qualified name of the destination log file.
#A timestamp will be appended to the given filename for each run of stack.sh.
LOGFILE=$DEST/logs/stack.sh.log

#Old log files are cleaned automatically if LOGDAYS is set to 
#the number of days of old log files to keep.
LOGDAYS=1

#Some coloring is used during the DevStack runs to 
#make it easier to see what is going on. 
LOG_COLOR=True

#When using the logfile, by default logs are sent to the console and the file. 
#You can set VERBOSE to false if you only wish the logs to be sent to the file 
#(this may avoid having double-logging in some cases where you are capturing 
#the script output and the log files). If VERBOSE is true you can additionally 
#set VERBOSE_NO_TIMESTAMP to avoid timestamps being added to each output line 
#sent to the console.
VERBOSE=True
VERBOSE_NO_TIMESTAMP=True

#======================Image=======================
#Default guest-images are predefined for each type of hypervisor and their 
#testing-requirements in stack.sh. Setting DOWNLOAD_DEFAULT_IMAGES=False 
#will prevent DevStack downloading these default images;
